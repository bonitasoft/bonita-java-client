    The REST API lets you access the data with HTTP requests; it is useful when implementing rich web forms / pages for a good user experience.

    If your application is using a technology other than Java, you can integrate it with the Bonita solution using the Web REST API. This API provides
    access to all Bonita objects (like processes, tasks, users, connectors etc.), to execute operations on them (create, retrieve, update, delete).
    You can use these operations to create a workflow with Bonita and integrate it into your application. The Bonita Engine remains responsible for executing
    the workflow logic (connectors, gateways with conditions, messages, timers etc.) while your application gives access to the workflow.
    Users can manage processes and tasks, and perform administrative activities.

    ### API Extensions

    You can create [Rest API Extensions](rest-api-extensions.md) to extend the Rest API by adding missing ressources (not provided by the Rest API).
    It is possible for an extension to interact with the engine (via the API) or with any other external service (for example a database, a directory, or a web service).

    ### Create a resource

    | Request URL | `http://.../API/{API_name}/{resource_name}/  `|
    |:-|:-|
    | Request Method | POST|
    | Request Payload | an item in JSON|
    | Response | the same item in JSON, containing the values provided in the posted item, completed with default values and identifiers provided by Bonita Engine.|

    ### Read a resource

    | Request URL | `http://.../API/{API_name}/{resource_name}/{id} `|
    |:-|:-|
    | Request Method | GET|
    | Response | an item in JSON|

    Example `http://.../API/identity/user/5 `

    #### Extend resource response

    On some resources, in GET methods the `d` (deploy) URL query parameter can be used to extend the response objects. The value of this parameter consists of an attribute for which you want to make an extended request (called a deploy) and retrieve attributes of a linked resource.
    This means that instead of retrieving the ID or a parent or referenced resource, you can retrieve the full object.

    For example, when you retrieve a task, you can also retrieve the process definition attributes in addition to the process definition ID that is already part of the task resource.
    The supported deploy values for a task include its process (d=processId).

    Specifiy multiple `d` parameter to extend several resources. For instance, to retrieve the flow node of id 143 and the associated process, process instance and assigned user, call `/API/bpm/flowNode/143?d=processId&d=caseId&d=assigned_id`

    #### With compound identifier

    The order of the identifier parts for each resource type is given in the table above.

    | Request URL | `http://.../API/{API_name}/{resource_name}/{id_part1}/{id_part2} `|
    |:-|:-|
    | Request Method | GET|
    | Response | an item in JSON|

    Example `http://.../API/identity/membership/5/12/24 `

    ### Update a resource

    | Request URL | `http://.../API/{API_name}/{resource_name}/{id} `|
    |:-|:-|
    | Request Method | PUT|
    | Request Payload | a map in JSON containing the new values for the attributes you want to change.|
    | Response | the corresponding item in JSON with new values where you requested a modification|

    Example `http://.../API/identity/user/5`

    #### With compound identifier:

    Response: the corresponding item in JSON with new values where you requested a modification.

    | Request URL | `http://.../API/{API_name}/{resource_name}/{id_part1}/{id_part2} `|
    |:-|:-|
    | Request Method | PUT|
    | Request Payload | ` a map in JSON containing the new values for the attributes you want to change `|
    | Response | ` the corresponding item in JSON with new values where you requested a modification`|

    Example
    `http://.../API/identity/membership/5/12/24 `

    ### Delete resources

    Use the DELETE request to remove multiple resources.

    | Request URL | `http://.../API/{API_name}/{resource_name}/ `|
    |:-|:-|
    | Request Method | DELETE|
    | Request Payload | A list of identifiers in JSON, for example `["id1","id2","id3"]`. Compound identifiers are separated by '/' characters.|
    | Response | `empty `|

    Example
    `http://.../API/identity/membership/ `

    ### Search for a resource

    The required object is specified with a set of filters in the request URL. The URL parameters must be URL-encoded.

    Results are returned in a paged list, so you have to specify the page (counting from zero), and the number of results per page (count), additionally you can define a sort key (order). You can see the total number of matching results in the HTTP response header Content-Range.
    If you are searching for business data using a custom query, there must be a [count query in the BDM](define-and-deploy-the-bdm.md). If there is no count query, results from a custom query on business data cannot be paged properly (the header Content-Range will be absent).
    For business data default queries, the count query is defined automatically.

    The available filters are the attributes of the item plus some specific filters defined by each item.

    | Request URL | `http://.../API/{API_name}/{resource_name}?p={page}&c={count}&o={order}&s={query}&f={filter_name}={filter_value}&f=... `|
    |:-|:-|
    | Request Method | GET|
    | Response | an array of items in JSON|

    Example
    `/API/identity/user?p=0&c=10&o=firstname&s=test&f=manager_id=3`

    For a GET method that retrieves more than one instance of a resource, you can specify the following request parameters:

    * p (Mandatory): index of the page to display
    * c (Mandatory): maximum number of elements to retrieve
    * o: order of presentation of values in response: must be either `attributeName ASC` or `attributeName DESC`. The final order parameter value must be URL encoded.
    * f: list of filters, specified as `attributeName=attributeValue`. To filter on more than one attribute, specify an f parameters for each attribute. The final filter parameter value must be URL encoded.
      The attributes you can filter on are specific to the resource.
    * s: search on name or search indexes. The matching policy depends on the configuration of [word-based search](using-list-and-search-methods.md).
      For example, if word-based search is enabled, `s=Valid` returns matches containing the string "valid" at the start of any word in the attribute value word,
      such as "Valid address", "Not a valid address", and "Validated request" but not "Invalid request".
      If word-based search is disabled, `s=Valid` returns matches containing the string "valid" at the start of the attribute value, such as "Valid address" or "Validated request" but not "Not a valid address" or "Invalid request".

    ### Errors

    The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call.

    If you get a `401` response code :
      - make sure that the cookies have been transfered with the call
      - make sure that the cookies transfered are the ones generated during the last sucessfull login call
      - if one of the PUT, DELETE or POST method is used, make sure that the `X-Bonita-API-Token` header is included
      - if the X-Bonita-API-Token header is included, make sure that the value is the same as the one of the cookie generated during the last login
      - Maybe a logout was issued or the session has expired; try to log in again, and re run the request with the new cookies and the new value for the `X-Bonita-API-Token` header.

    Show status or install or update the Business Data Model.

    Installing or updating a BDM on your tenant needs to be done in two successive steps:

    1. Upload a BDM file
    2. Install/Update the previously uploaded file

    **To do this, your tenant services need to be paused.**

    **In Enterprise editions, if you have an access control file installed on your tenant, you need to delete it before installing or updating your BDM.**

    Create REST API extensions to use third party systems (databases, web services, Bonita Engine, etc) data in forms and pages.

    REST API extensions can be used to query business data, Bonita Engine APIs, or an external information system (such as a database, web service, LDAP directory...). They also help to keep a clean separation between the front-end (forms, pages, and interfaces visible to users) and the back-end (processes).

        A call to the `/loginservice` will generates a set-cookie header in the response.

        The `JSESSIONID` cookie must be transfered with each subsequent calls. (If the REST API is used in an application running in a web browser, this is handled automatically by the web browser just like any cookies).

        Additional protection agains CSRF attacks is enabled by default for all fresh installations This security relies on `X-Bonita-API-Token` information.
        The `X-Bonita-API-Token` value can be found in the cookie named: `X-Bonita-API-Token`.

        All the subsequence REST API calls performing changes in the system using DELETE, POST, or PUT HTTP methods must contain the **HTTP header** below:

        * `assigned_id={user_id}`: retrieve only the manual tasks assigned to the specified user. For example, retrieve the manual tasks assigned to user with id 1: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&f=assigned_id%3d1`.
        * `state=skipped | ready | completed | failed` : retrieve only the manual tasks with the specified state. For example, retrieve the ready tasks: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&f=state%3dready`.
        * `caseId={case_id}`: retrieve only the manual tasks created in the specified process instances. For example, retrieve the manual tasks for the case\_id 2: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&f=caseId%3d2`.
        * `parentTaskId={parentTask_id}`: retrieve only the manual tasks for a specific parentTask. For example, retrieve the manual tasks for the parentTask\_id 40001: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&f=parentTaskId%3d40001`.

        You can search on:

        * name: search all manual tasks with a name that starts with the search string. For example, search for all manual tasks that have a name that starts with MySubTask: `/API/bpm/manualTask?p=0&c=10&s=MySubTask`.

        It is possible to filter on three parameters: `submittedBy`, `name` and `description`.

         * `submittedBy="id"`: search for documents that were submitted by the user with the specified identifier.
         * `name="string"`: search for documents with names that contain _string_.
           Depending on the setting for [word-based search](using-list-and-search-methods.md), the search returns documents with _string_ at the start of the name or the start of a word in the name.

            The response includes the "url" to use to download the content. Call the documentDownload servlet with this URL: /portal/documentDownload?fileName=doc.jpg&contentStorageId=4. Note: Since Bonita 7.10, document url fileName is now URL encoded. This will avoid errors when a document to be downloaded contains special characters in its name.
            In the previous versions, a workaround was necessary client-side using the javascript native function "encodeURI" to generate document download url. You can now remove this workaround.

        Update the ProcessInstanceDocument for the given ID

        You update a document in a process instance by uploading a new version of the document using a PUT method. You can upload a document version from the local file system or by URL. The document name will be used in all the process instances of the process, but the combination of process instance id and document name is unique.
        In the URL, you specify to supply the document id. This is included in the response when you first add a document to a process instances.
        The response to PUT methods is the same as for POST methods.

        Finds ArchivedProcessInstanceDocuments with pagination params and filters

        You can filter on :

        * `sourceObjectId="id"`: search for documents by specifying the original document id.
          This is useful if you know the id of a ProcessInstanceDocument and you wish to retrieve all its previous versions..
        * `caseId="id"`: search for documents with the specified open process instance id.
        * `archivedProcessInstanceId="id"`: search for documents with the specified archvied process instance id.
        * `submittedBy="id"`: search for documents that were submitted by the user with the specified identifier.
        * `name="string"`: search for documents with names that contain _string_.
          Depending on the setting for [word-based search](using-list-and-search-methods.md), the search returns documents with _string_ at the start of the name or the start of a word in the name.
        * `description="string"`: search for documents with descriptions that contain _string_.
          Depending on the setting for [word-based search](using-list-and-search-methods.md), the search returns documents with _string_ at the start of the description or the start of a word in the description.

        **Warning: Beware! Data loss risk!**

        Deleting a process will automatically delete all its process instances (on-going and archived alike).
        Thus, the operation may take a long time, and fail if the transaction timeout is not large enough. This feature should only be used on non-production environments.

        Retrieve business data value. Depending on the object attribute loading policy,
        the API returns either the full object in JSON representation or the HATEOAS links to the object attributes.

        Long attributes use a string representation added in 7.0.1 as a workaround for the JavaScript integer spectrum issue.

        Representation of object attributes with an _always load_ policy:

        ```json
        {
          "persistenceId": _number_, // <-- deprecated
          "persistenceId_string": "_number_"
          "persistenceVersion": _number_, // <-- deprecated
          "persistenceVersion_string": "_number_"
          "attributeName":_attributeType_
          ...
        }
        ```

        The string representation added in 7.0.1 for Long attributes is a workaround for the JavaScript integer spectrum issue.

        HATEOAS representation of object attribute with a _load when needed_ policy:
        ```json
        "links":[
           {
           "rel":_string_
           "href":_uri_

        and the actor af a process. In an organization we have four member_types =
        USER, GROUP, ROLE and MEMBERSHIP (role in a group). You can assign a actor
        to a user by specifying a role and or a group, or specific user.
      example:
        id: 206
        actor_id: 2
        role_id: 4
        group_id: 8
